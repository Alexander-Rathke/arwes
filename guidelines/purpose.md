# Purpose

Arwes intends to materialize futuristic science fiction concepts in a toolset
you may use to create interfaces inspired by advanced technology, especially spatial,
influenced by alien conceptions.

Connected, augmented, and energized are the feelings sought in the experiences
provided by projects built with Arwes, so Arwes interfaces are intensive and rich.

But building modular, configurable, heavily animated, and interconnected interface
components for web applications from both design and functional perspectives
is not easy. Since there are plenty of places from which we could draw inspiration, the
concepts implemented in Arwes are opinionated and focused on certain experiential aspects.

These are the main fundamental ideas behind this project:

## Advanced Alien Technology

Arwes elements should looks like they were made with advanced technology based on
many fundamentally new scientific theories and created by developed alien
civilizations or human societies millennia away in the future.

But written and spoken languages with letters and numbers are still the primary
means of communication, and mechanical interactions are still needed to manipulate
controls.

Arwes design could be used in displays, virtual reality, augmented reality, and
even holograms, and it should give users the impression that they are controlling
sophisticated futuristic devices.

## Clean and Sleek

Design doesn't have to be cryptic to feel advanced. Elements should be shown clearly
enough to express ideas without getting lost in visual effects.

Sizes and spacing should be used properly to convey messages clearly. Controls and structural
elements should not be too big just because they are important. Content should be legible and
not convoluted or obfuscated.

Arwes interfaces should look polished and sophisticated.

## Functional

The elements in the experience should exist for a purpose, not just for display.
But they can be elaborated. These elements should express that they have a function.

All components in an experience should feel they are interconnected as a whole,
so the experience is not just functional, but intelligent. Actions in one place can echo in
other places or even broadcast to the whole system.

## Energetic and Vibrant

All components should connect with the user visually and aurally. By navigating,
things shouldn't just appear or disappear; they should feel as if they are being
assembled, evolved, and decomposed. The experience of using them should be that
of an explorer and also a creator.

Glowing elements should inspire energy and animation should activate it. Users
should feel connected with the system.
