An ideal Arwes project _beta_ release would be for the **2020 Q1**.

## 2014 - 2018

From 2014 to 2018 the project was released in alpha versions where the main
ideas have been tested out in real-world projects. Though many features were
limited, have little support / extensibility, or buggy. The plan was to
gather enough insight to decide and build the foundation of the framework.
